<b>Its 2025 now, time flies.</b> 
Looking back the deeply chronological structure of school; year 1, year 2, year 3, all the way till year 13 provides nicely a framework in which to precive time, through this numerical ordering i was continously concious of time passing and the progress till the end of school. 
In university this continues, although to a lesser extent as the semster of study you are in becomes less relevant, I for instance am currently in my seventh semester but i am regulararly in classes with students ranging from first semster students to master students. 

This is all to say that i feel my perception of time has changed drastically since i graduated school, i believe this change in part has come my graduation from institutions that are highly organized in the dimension of time.
Its kind of cliche but i feel like ive become more passive letting the ebs and flow of time carry me instead of paddeling through it with purpose.
Of course this is subjective and i can point to multiple instances in the past years where my own agency has shone through.

I plan to finish my bachelors degree this year (in eight semsters) one year longer than regelstudiezeit, after that the world unlocks for me and i become unbound by institutions organized in time.
The suspiciosn is, of course, that having such frameworks to organize time by is actually very useful not only logistically but also emotionally. Precieving time in the past few years has felt like a sudden schock like a lag spike in counter strike resolving.
Rather than a satisfying moment in which i can level headedly evaluate the chronology. 
Time will march on and learning to step in time cannot hurt.

So I have identified a problem and must now work towards solutions, I think the solution here is kind of obvious, just plan better.

Planning is of course a skill that i have left severly underdeveloped... I guess that makes for a good new years resolution for 2025.
I think a good place to start is probably todo lists... 
Ill update how this character development arc evolves ... 

I dont have much more to say for now,
and yes the ontological is in the works,

until then,
gorgi
