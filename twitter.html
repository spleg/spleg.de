            <div id= "an1"><h1>added This</h1><p1>So I deleted twitter a couple months ago, thats kinda why im building this place. Having a place for people to be able to interface with my art and thoughts is nice, im kinda an ameture at everything though i hope thats ok.</p1></div><br>
            <div id= "an2"><h1>god</h1><p1>do you belive in god? <br>im in the train and its running late. <img src="src/blog/god.JPG"> </p1></div><br>
            <div id= "an3"><h1>hungry</h1><p1>mm im hungry, food in like 2 hours proably</p1></div><br>
            <div id= "an4"><h1>reviews</h1><p1>I think reviews, escpecially negative ones are very silly. Be skeptical of anyone who would rather bash down instead of pedastooling up. </p1></div><br>
            <div id= "an5"><h1>posting into a void</h1><p1>Being scared of failure is kind of a classic, it really has though prevented me from releasing music.<p1><br>
                <p1>I cant become a failed artist if i never start posting art...</p1> <br>
                <p1> I think im growing out of this mindset though, little successes and positive comments have been sticking with me more and I now really do look forward to finish art and releasing it, even if its just to a expressionless void.</p1> <br>
                <p1> I hope you do the same, realizing your own vision for art is awesome. ok look at this picture + till next time<img src="src\blog\pretty weather.JPG"> </p1></div><br>
